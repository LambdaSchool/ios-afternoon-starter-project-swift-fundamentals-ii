//: ## 1. Create custom types to represent an Airport Departures display
//: ![Airport Departures](matthew-smith-5934-unsplash.jpg)
//: Look at data from [Departures at JFK Airport in NYC](https://www.airport-jfk.com/departures.php) for reference.
//:
//: a. Use an `enum` type for the FlightStatus (En Route, Scheduled, Canceled, Delayed, etc.)
//:
//: b. Use a struct to represent an `Airport` (Destination or Arrival)
//:
//: c. Use a struct to represent a `Flight`.
//:
//: d. Use a `Date?` for the departure time since it may be canceled.
//:
//: e. Use a `String?` for the Terminal, since it may not be set yet (i.e.: waiting to arrive on time)
//:
//: f. Use a class to represent a `DepartureBoard` with a list of departure flights, and the current airport

func dateConverter(date: Date) -> String {
    let dateFormatter = DateFormatter()
    dateFormatter.dateStyle = .none
    dateFormatter.timeStyle = .short
    return dateFormatter.string(from: date)
}

enum FlightStatus: String {
    case enRoute = "En Route"
    case scheduled = "Scheduled"
    case canceled = "Canceled"
    case delayed = "Delayed"
    case boarding = "Boarding"
}

struct Airport {
    let destination: String?
    let arrival: String?
}

struct Flight {
    let destination: String
    let airline: String
    let flightNumber: String
    let departureTime: Date?
    let terminal: String?
    let status: FlightStatus
}

class DepartureBoard {
    var flights: [Flight]
    var airport: Airport
    init(flights: [Flight], airport: Airport) {
        self.flights = flights
        self.airport = airport
   }
    func alertPassengers() {
        for flight in flights {
            var departTime = "TBD"
            if let departureTime = flight.departureTime {
                departTime = dateConverter(date: departureTime)
//                departTime = "\(departureTime)"
            }
            var flightTerminal = "TBD"
            if let terminal = flight.terminal {
                flightTerminal = terminal
            }
            switch flight.status {
            case .canceled:
                print("We're sorry your flight to \(flight.destination) was canceled, here is a $500 voucher.")
            case .scheduled:
                print("Your flight to \(flight.destination) is scheduled to depart at \(departTime) from terminal: \(flightTerminal)")
            case .enRoute:
                print("Your flight \(flight.flightNumber)is currently en route and on time. Scheduled departure time of \(departTime)")
            case .delayed:
                print("Your flight \(flight.flightNumber) to \(flight.destination) has been delayed.")
            case .boarding:
                print("Your flight is boarding, please head to terminal: \(flightTerminal) immediately. The doors are closing soon.")
            }
        }
    }
}


//: ## 2. Create 3 flights and add them to a departure board
//: a. For the departure time, use `Date()` for the current time
//:
//: b. Use the Array `append()` method to add `Flight`'s
//:
//: c. Make one of the flights `.canceled` with a `nil` departure time
//:
//: d. Make one of the flights have a `nil` terminal because it has not been decided yet.
//:
//: e. Stretch: Look at the API for [`DateComponents`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/datecomponents?language=objc) for creating a specific time
let AA341 = Flight(destination: "Los Angeles", airline: "American Airlines", flightNumber: "AA341", departureTime: Date(), terminal: "8", status: .scheduled)

let DL6121 = Flight(destination: "Boston", airline: "Delta Airlines", flightNumber: "DL6121", departureTime: nil, terminal: "4", status: .canceled)

let EK6071 = Flight(destination: "Chicago", airline: "Emirates", flightNumber: "EK6071", departureTime: Date(), terminal: nil,  status: .delayed)

     
//(timeInterval: 21600, since: Date()
//(timeInterval: 14400, since: Date()
let departureBoard = DepartureBoard(flights: [], airport: Airport(destination: nil, arrival: nil))

departureBoard.flights.append(AA341)
departureBoard.flights.append(DL6121)
departureBoard.flights.append(EK6071)

//: ## 3. Create a free-standing function that can print the flight information from the `DepartureBoard`
//: a. Use the function signature: `printDepartures(departureBoard:)`
//:
//: b. Use a `for in` loop to iterate over each departure
//:
//: c. Make your `FlightStatus` enum conform to `String` so you can print the `rawValue` String values from the `enum`. See the [enum documentation](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Enumerations.html).
//:
//: d. Print out the current DepartureBoard you created using the function

func printDepartures(departureBoard: DepartureBoard) {
    for flight in departureBoard.flights {
        let departureBoard = "Destination: \(flight.destination) Airline: \(flight.airline) Flight: \(flight.flightNumber) Departure: \(String(describing: flight.departureTime))) Terminal: \(flight.terminal ?? "") Flight Status: \(flight.status.rawValue)"
        
        print(departureBoard)
    }
}

printDepartures(departureBoard: departureBoard)

//: ## 4. Make a second function to print print an empty string if the `departureTime` is nil
//: a. Createa new `printDepartures2(departureBoard:)` or modify the previous function
//:
//: b. Use optional binding to unwrap any optional values, use string interpolation to turn a non-optional date into a String
//:
//: c. Call the new or udpated function. It should not print `Optional(2019-05-30 17:09:20 +0000)` for departureTime or for the Terminal.
//:
//: d. Stretch: Format the time string so it displays only the time using a [`DateFormatter`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/dateformatter) look at the `dateStyle` (none), `timeStyle` (short) and the `string(from:)` method
//:
//: e. Your output should look like:
//:
//:     Destination: Los Angeles Airline: Delta Air Lines Flight: KL 6966 Departure Time:  Terminal: 4 Status: Canceled
//:     Destination: Rochester Airline: Jet Blue Airways Flight: B6 586 Departure Time: 1:26 PM Terminal:  Status: Scheduled
//:     Destination: Boston Airline: KLM Flight: KL 6966 Departure Time: 1:26 PM Terminal: 4 Status: Scheduled

func printDepartures2(departureBoard: DepartureBoard) {
    for flight in departureBoard.flights {
        var departureBoard = ("Destination: \(flight.destination) Airline: \(flight.airline) Flight: \(flight.flightNumber)")
        if let departureTime = flight.departureTime {
            departureBoard.append(" Departure: \(dateConverter(date: departureTime))")
        } else {
            departureBoard.append("")
        }
        if let terminal = flight.terminal {
            departureBoard.append(" Terminal: \(terminal)")
        } else {
            departureBoard.append("")
        }
        departureBoard.append(" Status: \(flight.status)")
        
        print(departureBoard)

    }
}
printDepartures2(departureBoard: departureBoard)


//: ## 5. Add an instance method to your `DepatureBoard` class (above) that can send an alert message to all passengers about their upcoming flight. Loop through the flights and use a `switch` on the flight status variable.
//: a. If the flight is canceled print out: "We're sorry your flight to \(city) was canceled, here is a $500 voucher"
//:
//: b. If the flight is scheduled print out: "Your flight to \(city) is scheduled to depart at \(time) from terminal: \(terminal)"
//:
//: c. If their flight is boarding print out: "Your flight is boarding, please head to terminal: \(terminal) immediately. The doors are closing soon."
//:
//: d. If the `departureTime` or `terminal` are optional, use "TBD" instead of a blank String
//:
//: e. If you have any other cases to handle please print out appropriate messages
//:
//: d. Call the `alertPassengers()` function on your `DepartureBoard` object below
//:
//: f. Stretch: Display a custom message if the `terminal` is `nil`, tell the traveler to see the nearest information desk for more details.
departureBoard.alertPassengers()





//: ## 6. Create a free-standing function to calculate your total airfair for checked bags and destination
//: Use the method signature, and return the airfare as a `Double`
//:
//:     func calculateAirfare(checkedBags: Int, distance: Int, travelers: Int) -> Double {
//:     }
//:
//: a. Each bag costs $25
//:
//: b. Each mile costs $0.10
//:
//: c. Multiply the ticket cost by the number of travelers
//:
//: d. Call the function with a variety of inputs (2 bags, 2000 miles, 3 travelers = $750)
//:
//: e. Make sure to cast the numbers to the appropriate types so you calculate the correct airfare
//:
//: f. Stretch: Use a [`NumberFormatter`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/numberformatter) with the `currencyStyle` to format the amount in US dollars.
func convertToCurrency(amount: Double) -> String {
    let currencyFormatter = NumberFormatter()
    currencyFormatter.numberStyle = .currency
    return currencyFormatter.string(from: NSNumber(value: amount))!
}

func calculateAirfare(checkedBags: Int, distance: Int, travelers: Int) -> Double {
    var grandTotal: Double = 0.00
    let planeTicket: Double = 166.67
    let bagsTotal = Double(checkedBags) * 25
    let milesTotal = Double(distance) * 0.1
    let ticketsTotal = Double(travelers) * planeTicket
    grandTotal = bagsTotal + milesTotal + ticketsTotal
    
    return grandTotal
}

print(convertToCurrency(amount: calculateAirfare(checkedBags: 2, distance: 2000, travelers: 3)))
print(convertToCurrency(amount: calculateAirfare(checkedBags: 4, distance: 2500, travelers: 4)))
print(convertToCurrency(amount: calculateAirfare(checkedBags: 6, distance: 1200, travelers: 8)))
