//: ## 1. Create custom types to represent an Airport Departures display
//: ![Airport Departures](matthew-smith-5934-unsplash.jpg)
//: Look at data from [Departures at JFK Airport in NYC](https://www.airport-jfk.com/departures.php) for reference.
//:
//: a. Use an `enum` type for the FlightStatus (En Route, Scheduled, Canceled, Delayed, etc.)
//:
//: b. Use a struct to represent an `Airport` (Destination or Arrival)
//:
//: c. Use a struct to represent a `Flight`.
//:
//: d. Use a `Date?` for the departure time since it may be canceled.
//:
//: e. Use a `String?` for the Terminal, since it may not be set yet (i.e.: waiting to arrive on time)
//:
//: f. Use a class to represent a `DepartureBoard` with a list of departure flights, and the current airport
enum FlightStatus: String {
    case enroute = "Enroute"
    case scheduled = "Schedule"
    case canceled = "Cancelled"
    case delayed = "Delayed"
}

struct Airport {
    let arrrivalAirport: String
}

struct Flight {
    let departureTime: Date?
    let departureTerminal: Int?
    let airline: String
    let flightNumber: Int
    let airportDestination: String
    let flightStatus: FlightStatus
}

class DepartureBoard {
    var airports: [Airport]
    var flights: [Flight]
//    var airports: [Airport]"
//    var status: [FlightStatus]
    
    init(flights: [Flight], airports: [Airport]) {
        self.flights = flights
        self.airports = airports
    }
}

//: ## 2. Create 3 flights and add them to a departure board
//: a. For the departure time, use `Date()` for the current time
//:
//: b. Use the Array `append()` method to add `Flight`'s
//:
//: c. Make one of the flights `.canceled` with a `nil` departure time
//:
//: d. Make one of the flights have a `nil` terminal because it has not been decided yet.
//:
//: e. Stretch: Look at the API for [`DateComponents`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/datecomponents?language=objc) for creating a specific time
let flightOne = Flight(departureTime: Date(), departureTerminal: 2, airline: "Delta", flightNumber: 2377, airportDestination: "London", flightStatus: .canceled)
let flightTwo = Flight(departureTime: Date(), departureTerminal: nil, airline: "Delta", flightNumber: 5644, airportDestination: "Berlin", flightStatus: .enroute)
let flightThree = Flight(departureTime: Date(), departureTerminal: 7, airline: "Delta", flightNumber: 4443, airportDestination: "Tokyo", flightStatus: .enroute)

var flightsArray = [flightOne]

let airportOne = Airport(arrrivalAirport: "Los Angeles")
var airportsArray = [airportOne]

var myDepartureBoard = DepartureBoard.init(flights: flightsArray, airports: airportsArray)

let airportTwo = Airport(arrrivalAirport: "New Dehli")
let airportThree = Airport(arrrivalAirport: "Tokyo")

let airportsArrayNew = [airportTwo, airportThree]

myDepartureBoard.airports.append(contentsOf: airportsArrayNew)

myDepartureBoard.flights.append(flightTwo)
myDepartureBoard.flights.append(flightThree)


//: ## 3. Create a free-standing function that can print the flight information from the `DepartureBoard`
//: a. Use the function signature: `printDepartures(departureBoard:)`
//:
//: b. Use a `for in` loop to iterate over each departure
//:
//: c. Make your `FlightStatus` enum conform to `String` so you can print the `rawValue` String values from the `enum`. See the [enum documentation](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Enumerations.html).
//:
//: d. Print out the current DepartureBoard you created using the function


func printDepartures() {
    for n in 0...(myDepartureBoard.flights.count-1) {
        print("Destination: \(myDepartureBoard.flights[n].airportDestination)")
        print("Airline: \(myDepartureBoard.flights[n].airline)")
        print("Flight: \(myDepartureBoard.flights[n].flightNumber)")
        print("Time: \(myDepartureBoard.flights[n].departureTime)")
        print("Terminal: \(myDepartureBoard.flights[n].departureTerminal)")
        print("Status: \(myDepartureBoard.flights[n].flightStatus.rawValue)")
    }
}

printDepartures()


//: ## 4. Make a second function to print print an empty string if the `departureTime` is nil
//: a. Createa new `printDepartures2(departureBoard:)` or modify the previous function
//:
//: b. Use optional binding to unwrap any optional values, use string interpolation to turn a non-optional date into a String
//:
//: c. Call the new or udpated function. It should not print `Optional(2019-05-30 17:09:20 +0000)` for departureTime or for the Terminal.
//:
//: d. Stretch: Format the time string so it displays only the time using a [`DateFormatter`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/dateformatter) look at the `dateStyle` (none), `timeStyle` (short) and the `string(from:)` method
//:
//: e. Your output should look like:
//:
//:     Destination: Los Angeles Airline: Delta Air Lines Flight: KL 6966 Departure Time:  Terminal: 4 Status: Canceled
//:     Destination: Rochester Airline: Jet Blue Airways Flight: B6 586 Departure Time: 1:26 PM Terminal:  Status: Scheduled
//:     Destination: Boston Airline: KLM Flight: KL 6966 Departure Time: 1:26 PM Terminal: 4 Status: Scheduled
var dateFormatter = DateFormatter()
dateFormatter.timeStyle = .medium



func printDeparture2() {
    for n in 0...(myDepartureBoard.flights.count-1) {
        print("Destination: \(myDepartureBoard.flights[n].airportDestination)")
        print("Airline: \(myDepartureBoard.flights[n].airline)")
        print("Flight: \(myDepartureBoard.flights[n].flightNumber)")
        if let unwrappedDepartureTime = myDepartureBoard.flights[n].departureTime {
            let formattedDepartureTime = dateFormatter.string(from: unwrappedDepartureTime)
            print("Time: \(formattedDepartureTime)")
        }
        if let unwrappedDepartureTerminal = myDepartureBoard.flights[n].departureTerminal {
            print("Terminal: \(unwrappedDepartureTerminal)")
        }
        print("Status: \(myDepartureBoard.flights[n].flightStatus.rawValue)")
    }
}
printDeparture2()


//let currencyAirfare = formatter.string(for: totalAirfare)!

//: ## 5. Add an instance method to your `DepatureBoard` class (above) that can send an alert message to all passengers about their upcoming flight. Loop through the flights and use a `switch` on the flight status variable.
//: a. If the flight is canceled print out: "We're sorry your flight to \(city) was canceled, here is a $500 voucher"
//:
//: b. If the flight is scheduled print out: "Your flight to \(city) is scheduled to depart at \(time) from terminal: \(terminal)"
//:
//: c. If their flight is boarding print out: "Your flight is boarding, please head to terminal: \(terminal) immediately. The doors are closing soon."
//:
//: d. If the `departureTime` or `terminal` are optional, use "TBD" instead of a blank String
//:
//: e. If you have any other cases to handle please print out appropriate messages
//:
//: d. Call the `alertPassengers()` function on your `DepartureBoard` object below
//:
//: f. Stretch: Display a custom message if the `terminal` is `nil`, tell the traveler to see the nearest information desk for more details.
func alertPassengers() {
    for n in 0...(myDepartureBoard.flights.count-1) {
        let flightAlert = myDepartureBoard.flights[n].flightStatus
        switch flightAlert {
        case.canceled:
            print("We're sorry your flight to \(myDepartureBoard.flights[n].airportDestination) was canceled, here is a $500 voucher")
        case.delayed:
            print("Your flight to \(myDepartureBoard.flights[n].airportDestination) is delayed")
        case.enroute:
            print("Hope you're enjoying your flight to \(myDepartureBoard.flights[n].airportDestination)!")
        case.scheduled:
            print("Your flight to \(myDepartureBoard.flights[n].airportDestination) is scheduled to depart at \(myDepartureBoard.flights[n].departureTime ?? "TBD")")
        default:
            break
        }
        }
}
alertPassengers()
    
//: ## 6. Create a free-standing function to calculate your total airfair for checked bags and destination
//: Use the method signature, and return the airfare as a `Double`
//:
//:     func calculateAirfare(checkedBags: Int, distance: Int, travelers: Int) -> Double {
//:     }
//:
//: a. Each bag costs $25
//:
//: b. Each mile costs $0.10
//:
//: c. Multiply the ticket cost by the number of travelers
//:
//: d. Call the function with a variety of inputs (2 bags, 2000 miles, 3 travelers = $750)
//:
//: e. Make sure to cast the numbers to the appropriate types so you calculate the correct airfare
//:
//: f. Stretch: Use a [`NumberFormatter`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/numberformatter) with the `currencyStyle` to format the amount in US dollars.

func calculateAirfare (checkedBags: Int, distance: Int, Travelers: Int) -> String {
    let bagCost = Double(checkedBags) * 25.0
    let mileageCost = Double(distance) * 0.10
    let passengerCost = Double(Travelers) * 750
    let totalAirfare = bagCost + mileageCost + passengerCost
    
    let formatter = NumberFormatter()
    formatter.numberStyle = .currency
    
    let currencyAirfare = formatter.string(for: totalAirfare)!
    
    return currencyAirfare
}
    
print(calculateAirfare(checkedBags: 3, distance: 1000, Travelers: 2))
