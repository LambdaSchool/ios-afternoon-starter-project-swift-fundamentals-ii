//: ## 1. Create custom types to represent an Airport Departures display
//: ![Airport Departures](matthew-smith-5934-unsplash.jpg)
//: Look at data from [Departures at JFK Airport in NYC](https://www.airport-jfk.com/departures.php) for reference.
//:
//: a. Use an `enum` type for the FlightStatus (En Route, Scheduled, Canceled, Delayed, etc.)
//:
//: b. Use a struct to represent an `Airport` (Destination or Arrival)
//:
//: c. Use a struct to represent a `Flight`.
//:
//: d. Use a `Date?` for the departure time since it may be canceled.
//:
//: e. Use a `String?` for the Terminal, since it may not be set yet (i.e.: waiting to arrive on time)
//:
//: f. Use a class to represent a `DepartureBoard` with a list of departure flights, and the current airport

/* 3. Create a free-Standing function that can print the flight information from the DepartureBoard
 a. Use the function signature: printDeparture(departureBoard:)
 b. Use a for in loop to iterate over each departure
 c. Make your FlightStatus enum conform to String so you can print the rawValue String values from the enum. see the enum documentation.
 d. Print out the current DepartureBoard you created using the funciton.*/

/*4. Make a second function to print an empty string if the departureTime is nil
a. Create a new printDepartures2(departureBoard:) or modify the previous function
b. Use optional binding to unwrap any optional values, use string interpolation to turn a non-optional date into a String
c. Call the new or udpated function. It should not print Optional(2019-05-30 17:09:20 +0000) for departureTime or for the Terminal.
d. Stretch: Format the time string so it displays only the time using a DateFormatter look at the dateStyle (none), timeStyle (short) and the string(from:) method
e. Your output should look like:
Destination: Los Angeles Airline: Delta Air Lines Flight: KL 6966 Departure Time: Terminal: 4 Status: Canceled
Destination: Rochester Airline: Jet Blue Airways Flight: B6 586 Departure Time: 1:26 PM Terminal: Status: Scheduled

// Needs work on the formatting.

//: ## 5. Add an instance method to your `DepatureBoard` class (above) that can send an alert message to all passengers about their upcoming flight. Loop through the flights and use a `switch` on the flight status variable.
//: a. If the flight is canceled print out: "We're sorry your flight to \(city) was canceled, here is a $500 voucher"
//:
//: b. If the flight is scheduled print out: "Your flight to \(city) is scheduled to depart at \(time) from terminal: \(terminal)"
//:
//: c. If their flight is boarding print out: "Your flight is boarding, please head to terminal: \(terminal) immediately. The doors are closing soon."
//:
//: d. If the `departureTime` or `terminal` are optional, use "TBD" instead of a blank String
//:
//: e. If you have any other cases to handle please print out appropriate messages
//:
//: d. Call the `alertPassengers()` function on your `DepartureBoard` object below
//:
//: f. Stretch: Display a custom message if the `terminal` is `nil`, tell the traveler to see the nearest information desk for more details.

func alertMessage(departureBoard: DepartureBoard) {
    for flight in departureBoard.flights {
        let dateFormatter = DateFormatter()
        dateFormatter.dateStyle = .none
        dateFormatter.timeStyle = .short
        
        var time: String = ""
        if flight.departureTime != nil {
            time = dateFormatter.string(from: flight.departureTime!)
        } else {
            time = "TBD"
        }
        
        var terminal: String = ""
        if flight.terminal != nil {
            terminal = flight.terminal!

            print("Your flight is en route but you will be arriving at \(flight.destination.city) later than expected. We apologize for the delay.")

            print("Yor flight is en route and will be arriving at \(flight.destination.city) on schedule.")

alertMessage(departureBoard: departureBoard)



// I can see that this code is redundant and therefore not best practices. But the way number 4 is phrased asks us to use optional binding instead of using a guard let. And it asks us to do it within the print2 function. Then to be able to access it again inside of this switch statement, I need to have it somewhere outside of the print2 function. May as well just repeat it here.

//: ## 6. Create a free-standing function to calculate your total airfair for checked bags and destination
//: Use the method signature, and return the airfare as a `Double`
//:
//:     func calculateAirfare(checkedBags: Int, distance: Int, travelers: Int) -> Double {
//:     }
//:
//: a. Each bag costs $25
//:
//: b. Each mile costs $0.10
//:
//: c. Multiply the ticket cost by the number of travelers
//:
//: d. Call the function with a variety of inputs (2 bags, 2000 miles, 3 travelers = $750)
//:
//: e. Make sure to cast the numbers to the appropriate types so you calculate the correct airfare
//:
//: f. Stretch: Use a [`NumberFormatter`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/numberformatter) with the `currencyStyle` to format the amount in US dollars.
func calculateAirfare(checkedBags: Int, distance: Int, travelers: Int) -> Double {
    return ((Double(checkedBags) * 25.0) + ((Double(distance) * 0.10) * Double(travelers)))
}

let price = calculateAirfare(checkedBags: 2, distance: 2000, travelers: 3) as NSNumber


let numberFormatter = NumberFormatter()
numberFormatter.numberStyle = .currency
if let formattedPrice = numberFormatter.string(from: price) {
    print(formattedPrice)
}

// Sloppy but functional!
