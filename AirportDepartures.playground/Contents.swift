//: ## 1. Create custom types to represent an Airport Departures display
//: ![Airport Departures](matthew-smith-5934-unsplash.jpg)
//: Look at data from [Departures at JFK Airport in NYC](https://www.airport-jfk.com/departures.php) for reference.
//:
//: a. Use an `enum` type for the FlightStatus (En Route, Scheduled, Canceled, Delayed, etc.)
//:
//: b. Use a struct to represent an `Airport` (Destination or Arrival)
//:
//: c. Use a struct to represent a `Flight`.
//:
//: d. Use a `Date?` for the departure time since it may be canceled.
//:
//: e. Use a `String?` for the Terminal, since it may not be set yet (i.e.: waiting to arrive on time)
//:
//: f. Use a class to represent a `DepartureBoard` with a list of departure flights, and the current airport

enum FlightStatus:String {
    
    case EnRoute
    case Scheduled
    case Canceled
    case Delayed
    case Arrived
    case Boarding
}

struct Airport {
 
    let airport: String
}

struct Flight {
    let destination: String
    let airline: String
    let flight: String
    let departureTime: Date?
    let terminal: String?
    let status: FlightStatus
}

class DepartureBoard {
    let currentAirport: Airport
    var flights: [Flight]
    
    init(currentAirport: Airport, flights: [Flight]) {
        self.currentAirport = currentAirport
        self.flights = flights
    }
    
    func flightAlert(departureBoard:DepartureBoard) {
        let terminalMessage = "Please see the nearest information desk for more information about your flight."
        for flight in departureBoard.flights {
            if flight.terminal == nil {
                print(terminalMessage)
            } else {
                switch flight.status {
                case .Canceled:
                    print("We're sorry your flight to \(flight.destination) was canceled, here is a $500 voucher.")
                case .Scheduled:
                    print("Your flight to \(flight.destination) is scheduled to depart at \(String(describing: time)) from terminal: \(flight.terminal ?? " ").")
                case .Boarding:
                    print("Your flight is boarding, please head to terminal:\(flight.terminal ?? "TBD") immediately. The doors are closing soon.")
                case .EnRoute:
                    print("We our arriving at our \(flight.destination) soon. Please fasten your seatbelts.")
                case .Delayed:
                    print("We are sorry your flight to \(flight.destination) is delayed. We will let you know your new departure time shortly.")
                default:
                    ("Would you like to buy a flight ticket?")
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
//: ## 2. Create 3 flights and add them to a departure board
//: a. For the departure time, use `Date()` for the current time
//:
//: b. Use the Array `append()` method to add `Flight`'s
//:
//: c. Make one of the flights `.canceled` with a `nil` departure time
//:
//: d. Make one of the flights have a `nil` terminal because it has not been decided yet.
//:
//: e. Stretch: Look at the API for [`DateComponents`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/datecomponents?language=objc) for creating a specific time
let now = Date()
let formatter = DateFormatter()
formatter.timeStyle = .short
let time = formatter.string(from: now)

print(time)

let flight1 = Flight(destination: "Cleveland", airline: "Delta Airlines", flight: "DL5850", departureTime: now, terminal: "4", status: .Scheduled)

let flight2 = Flight(destination: "Miami", airline: "Air France", flight: "AF3497", departureTime: now, terminal: "4", status: .Delayed)

let flight3 = Flight(destination: "Seattle", airline: "Alaska Airlines", flight: "AS160", departureTime: nil, terminal: nil, status: .Canceled)

var departureBoard1 = DepartureBoard(currentAirport: Airport(airport: "JFK"), flights: [])

    
departureBoard1.flights.append(flight1)
departureBoard1.flights.append(flight2)
departureBoard1.flights.append(flight3)



//: ## 3. Create a free-standing function that can print the flight information from the `DepartureBoard`
//: a. Use the function signature: `printDepartures(departureBoard:)`
//:
//: b. Use a `for in` loop to iterate over each departure
//:
//: c. Make your `FlightStatus` enum conform to `String` so you can print the `rawValue` String values from the `enum`. See the [enum documentation](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Enumerations.html).
//:
//: d. Print out the current DepartureBoard you created using the function
func printDepartures(departureBoard:DepartureBoard) {
    for flight in departureBoard.flights {
        print(flight.status.rawValue)
    }
}

printDepartures(departureBoard: departureBoard1)


//: ## 4. Make a second function to print print an empty string if the `departureTime` is nil
//: a. Createa new `printDepartures2(departureBoard:)` or modify the previous function
//:
//: b. Use optional binding to unwrap any optional values, use string interpolation to turn a non-optional date into a String
//:
//: c. Call the new or udpated function. It should not print `Optional(2019-05-30 17:09:20 +0000)` for departureTime or for the Terminal.
//:
//: d. Stretch: Format the time string so it displays only the time using a [`DateFormatter`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/dateformatter) look at the `dateStyle` (none), `timeStyle` (short) and the `string(from:)` method
//:
//: e. Your output should look like:
//:
//:     Destination: Los Angeles Airline: Delta Air Lines Flight: KL 6966 Departure Time:  Terminal: 4 Status: Canceled
//:     Destination: Rochester Airline: Jet Blue Airways Flight: B6 586 Departure Time: 1:26 PM Terminal:  Status: Scheduled
//:     Destination: Boston Airline: KLM Flight: KL 6966 Departure Time: 1:26 PM Terminal: 4 Status: Scheduled
func printDepartures2(departureBoard:DepartureBoard) {
    for flight in departureBoard.flights {
        
        if flight.departureTime == nil {

            print("Destination:", flight.destination,"Airline:",flight.airline,"Flight:",flight.flight,"Departure Time: N/A Terminal:",flight.terminal ?? "N/A","Status:",flight.status)
        } else {
           print("Destination:",flight.destination, "Airline:",flight.airline,"Flight:",flight.flight,"Departure Time:",time,"Terminal:",flight.terminal ?? "N/A","Status:",flight.status)
        }
}
}
printDepartures2(departureBoard: departureBoard1)

//: ## 5. Add an instance method to your `DepatureBoard` class (above) that can send an alert message to all passengers about their upcoming flight. Loop through the flights and use a `switch` on the flight status variable.
//: a. If the flight is canceled print out: "We're sorry your flight to \(city) was canceled, here is a $500 voucher"
//:
//: b. If the flight is scheduled print out: "Your flight to \(city) is scheduled to depart at \(time) from terminal: \(terminal)"
//:
//: c. If their flight is boarding print out: "Your flight is boarding, please head to terminal: \(terminal) immediately. The doors are closing soon."
//:
//: d. If the `departureTime` or `terminal` are optional, use "TBD" instead of a blank String
//:
//: e. If you have any other cases to handle please print out appropriate messages
//:
//: d. Call the `alertPassengers()` function on your `DepartureBoard` object below
//:
//: f. Stretch: Display a custom message if the `terminal` is `nil`, tell the traveler to see the nearest information desk for more details.
departureBoard1.flightAlert(departureBoard: departureBoard1)

        


//: ## 6. Create a free-standing function to calculate your total airfair for checked bags and destination
//: Use the method signature, and return the airfare as a `Double`
//:
//:     func calculateAirfare(checkedBags: Int, distance: Int, travelers: Int) -> Double {
//:     }
//:
//: a. Each bag costs $25
//:
//: b. Each mile costs $0.10
//:
//: c. Multiply the ticket cost by the number of travelers
//:
//: d. Call the function with a variety of inputs (2 bags, 2000 miles, 3 travelers = $750)
//:
//: e. Make sure to cast the numbers to the appropriate types so you calculate the correct airfare
//:
//: f. Stretch: Use a [`NumberFormatter`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/numberformatter) with the `currencyStyle` to format the amount in US dollars.
func calculateAirfare(checkedBags: Int, distance: Int, travelers: Int) -> String{
    
    let bagTotal = checkedBags * 25
    let distanceTotal = Double(distance) * 0.10
    let ticket:Double = Double(bagTotal) + distanceTotal
    let total = ticket * Double(travelers)
    let number = NSNumber(value: total)
    let numberFormatter = NumberFormatter()
    numberFormatter.numberStyle = .currency
    guard let price = (numberFormatter.string(from: number)) else {return "Cannot calculate airfare."}
    
    return price
}
print(calculateAirfare(checkedBags:6, distance: 2000, travelers: 3))
