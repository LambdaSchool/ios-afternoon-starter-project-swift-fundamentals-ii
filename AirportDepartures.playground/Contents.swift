//: ## 1. Create custom types to represent an Airport Departures display
//: ![Airport Departures](matthew-smith-5934-unsplash.jpg)
//: Look at data from [Departures at JFK Airport in NYC](https://www.airport-jfk.com/departures.php) for reference.
//:
//: a. Use an `enum` type for the FlightStatus (En Route, Scheduled, Canceled, Delayed, etc.)
//:
//: b. Use a struct to represent an `Airport` (Destination or Arrival)
//:
//: c. Use a struct to represent a `Flight`.
//:
//: d. Use a `Date?` for the departure time since it may be canceled.
//:
//: e. Use a `String?` for the Terminal, since it may not be set yet (i.e.: waiting to arrive on time)
//:
//: f. Use a class to represent a `DepartureBoard` with a list of departure flights, and the current airport

/* 2. Create 3 flights and add them to a departure board
a. For the departure time, use Date() for the current time  //Is that an Apple provided method or did we define it somewhere?
b. Use the Array append() method to add Flightâ€™s
c. Make one of the flights .canceled with a nil departure time
d. Make one of the flights have a nil terminal because it has not been decided yet.
e. Stretch: Look at the API for DateComponents for creating a specific time */

departureBoard.flights.append(flight1)

departureBoard.flights.append(flight3)

/* 3. Create a free-Standing function that can print the flight information from the DepartureBoard
 a. Use the function signature: printDeparture(departureBoard:)
 b. Use a for in loop to iterate over each departure
 c. Make your FlightStatus enum conform to String so you can print the rawValue String values from the enum. see the enum documentation.
 d. Print out the current DepartureBoard you created using the funciton.*/

func printDeparture(departureBoard: DepartureBoard) {
    for flight in departureBoard.flights {
        print(flight.destination.abbreviation, flight.destination.city, flight.airline, flight.flightNumber, flight.depatureTime, flight.terminal, flight.status.rawValue)
    }
}

printDeparture(departureBoard: departureBoard)


//: ## 5. Add an instance method to your `DepatureBoard` class (above) that can send an alert message to all passengers about their upcoming flight. Loop through the flights and use a `switch` on the flight status variable.
//: a. If the flight is canceled print out: "We're sorry your flight to \(city) was canceled, here is a $500 voucher"
//:
//: b. If the flight is scheduled print out: "Your flight to \(city) is scheduled to depart at \(time) from terminal: \(terminal)"
//:
//: c. If their flight is boarding print out: "Your flight is boarding, please head to terminal: \(terminal) immediately. The doors are closing soon."
//:
//: d. If the `departureTime` or `terminal` are optional, use "TBD" instead of a blank String
//:
//: e. If you have any other cases to handle please print out appropriate messages
//:
//: d. Call the `alertPassengers()` function on your `DepartureBoard` object below
//:
//: f. Stretch: Display a custom message if the `terminal` is `nil`, tell the traveler to see the nearest information desk for more details.




//: ## 6. Create a free-standing function to calculate your total airfair for checked bags and destination
//: Use the method signature, and return the airfare as a `Double`
//:
//:     func calculateAirfare(checkedBags: Int, distance: Int, travelers: Int) -> Double {
//:     }
//:
//: a. Each bag costs $25
//:
//: b. Each mile costs $0.10
//:
//: c. Multiply the ticket cost by the number of travelers
//:
//: d. Call the function with a variety of inputs (2 bags, 2000 miles, 3 travelers = $750)
//:
//: e. Make sure to cast the numbers to the appropriate types so you calculate the correct airfare
//:
//: f. Stretch: Use a [`NumberFormatter`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/numberformatter) with the `currencyStyle` to format the amount in US dollars.
